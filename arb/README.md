The .asm assembly line code is technically incomplete and it is lacking some information and obviously obfuscated.
If you know how to read assembly, or can at least make enough sense of it, please make a pull request to THIS file and help further explain what's happpening and what the functions in use are - and how to change it to our liking.

The .cpp file is the assembly code decompiled into C++. It is not technically perfect but it gives us a great overview of things. However, C++ is not my language and I have to be focusing on other things right now in order to get this done. Any and all help making sense of what is happening would be extremely helpful and a great step in development. If I know what's happening, then I can play with what to change, where to change it, and how to change it.

Make a pull request.
